abstract: "The Unified Information-Density Theory (UIDT) presents a mathematical framework addressing the Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap Millennium Prize Problem. It introduces a dynamical information-density scalar field S(x) coupled to the gauge sector, providing a rigorous mechanism for mass generation while preserving asymptotic freedom, and is proven consistent with all Wightman axioms."
